TODO:
homescreen doesnt show anything in stage when theres no deck selected.
theres no way to go back after clicking practice on deck.
when theres a refresh the user is sent back to login. This is fixed by checking the jwt with the backend to stop the AUthContext useEffect() from taking over.
have the interface and <Deck/> working in sync.
Add functionality to edit a card in a deck.
Fix the practice card look , currently looks very poor.












DONE.
✓Made activeDeck a context

have <Deck/> show properly in the <Stage/>✓



------retired ----- this was a bad way to think about things. 
-make deckList a context, selectedDeck and deckList are getting too hard to look at ✓
-fix sidebar, give it normal colors, have it reach to end of the screen. ✓
-title, center title. maybe put it in top right of the screen or top left. It doesnt need to take up the whole top of the screen.✓
-remove the ContextProvider at the top of the app. I dont think I even use it , and its interfeering with doing the css of the app. ✓ 
-remove borders around decks in the sidebar ✓
-hide the buttons on DeckLink behind a meatball menu ✓
-meatball menu needs an icon ✓
-have library have a header, DECKLIST.✓ 
-center the Creator component in homescreen ✓
-change the fonts that is being used. ✓
-/homescreen/page.js. Currently decides if it renders <Controller/> or <Creator/> , controller should do this.✗
└problem was that the Controller was named incorrectly, now its DeckController. Creator and DeckController are concerned with different things
-navItems in libarary need to be layed out properly, in column order.✓
-navItems should have no border but onhover reacts✓
-round the edges for NavItems. ✓
-<Creator/>  has 2 card components, rendering.✓
-create directives for buttons✓
