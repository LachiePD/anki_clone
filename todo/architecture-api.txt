ARCHITECTURE AND API

Refactor backend to return deck data directly instead of data.response.rows.

Add username data validation checks inside AuthServices.fetchUser.

Move areCredentialsValid utility from the factory into the AuthService.

Implement backend service-level error handling for duplicate deck names.

Wire auth middleware directly into routes within the composition root.

useDeckList probably needs to become a context. Its getting difficult to deal with, but at the moment we're not too sure what Library will look like, it may lose its deckList manipulation ability.

the back isnt consitent enough, data structures always look different and that.


there needs to be a middleware to handle assertData() for the controllers. It will be used by all of them , will stop the need for repeating the import and use of  assertData() function

need to create a helper function in the  Service layer to check for valid response.
