next TODO.


make deckList a context, selectedDeck and deckList are getting too hard to look at ✓

in home screen, css:
-fix sidebar, give it normal colors, have it reach to end of the screen. ✓
-title, center title. maybe put it in top right of the screen or top left. It doesnt need to take up the whole top of the screen.✓


-the main area. Currently defaults to create a deck. Have a think about this, it could be used to point user to select a deck.--do later--

-have library have a header, DECKLIST. 
-remove borders around decks in the sidebard. 
-center the Creator component in homescreen

-look at different fonts to use



remove the ContextProvider at the top of the app. I dont think I even use it , and its interfeering with doing the css of the app.
